# Random Walks on Hypergraphs with Edge-Dependent Vertex Weights

This repo contains code for the experiments in "Random Walks on Hypergraphs with Edge-Dependent Vertex Weights" (ICML 2019). Each Jupyter notebook reproduces the figures/metrics from the paper.

`halo_experiments.ipynb` is for the Halo experiment from the main paper, which uses the files `HeadToHead.csv` and `FreeForAll.csv` (data from the [TrueSkill](TrueSkill: A Bayesian Skill Rating System) paper). `synthetic_experiments_supplement.ipynb` is for the experiments from supplement (Section H).
